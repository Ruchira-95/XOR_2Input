# XOR Gate Using CMOS 28nm Technology
Implementation of 2 input XOR gate using CMOS 28nm technology.

**Abstract**:- The scope of the work is to design a two input XOR gate using 28nm CMOS. Exclusive OR (XOR) gate is utilized in various digital system applications such as full adder, comparator, parity checker and controlled inverter.

Keywords- XOR, CMOS


*1. Introduction*

XOR gates have many application in digital systems. Hence it is necessary to implement these gates for their various applications. Implementing circuits using only universal gates will increase the number of gates used thus we need to use basic gates to reduce the number of gates in the circuit.

A MOSFET has 4 terminals drain, gate, source and substrate. CMOS means Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. The CMOS Transistor is constructed by both NMOS and PMOS Transistors. It is basically an integrated circuit built with those two transistors. As both the transistors are used, the CMOS has both characteristics. The NMOS transistors in the CMOS creates a low resistance path between the source and drain when the gate voltage is high and the PMOS transistor in the CMOS creates a low resistance path between the source and drain when the gate voltage is low.

*2. Circuit Design*

A XOR gate can be implemented using 10 MOSFETs, 5 NMOS and 5 PMOS each.
